* The peak hours in August 2019 were between 8:00-9:00AM and 4:00-7:00PM with 5:00PM being the hour with the highest number of rides. It is safe to assume these are commuting times to and from work.

#Summary

August 2019 demonstrates a high activity of NYC's Citibike share program. Most of the ride sharers were male riders, at 65% of riders. The peak hours of rides were in the morning and evenings. With that, it is safe to say that CitiBike share program is a great alternative to transportation for those who are communiting to and from work. Riders enjoyed using CitiBike during the weekends throughout the day, 9AM-8PM. While we looked at August 2019, it would be important to consider the ride share program during the winter months, when the road conditions may not be as conducive to bicyling.
